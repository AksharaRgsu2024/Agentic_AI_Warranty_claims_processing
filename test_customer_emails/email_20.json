  "body": "Dear BreezeLite,\n\nI'm moving to Germany for work next month and I was hoping to bring my BreezeLite BLD-Turbo 2400 hairdryer with me.\n\nI have a few questions about international use:\n\n1. Is this model dual voltage (110-240V)? I see it's rated for 2400W - will that work with European outlets?\n2. What kind of plug adapter would I need?\n3. Are there any warranty implications if I use it outside the United States?\n4. Should I be concerned about the power differences affecting the motor or heating element?\n\nI really like this hairdryer and would prefer not to buy a new one if I can avoid it.\n\nThank you,\nChristopher Smith\nchristopher.smith@email.com",
