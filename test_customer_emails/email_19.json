  "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm interested in purchasing the BreezeLite BLD-Curl Master dryer but I have a question before I buy.\n\nI have very fine, thin curly hair that tangles easily. I'm worried that the diffuser attachment might be too aggressive or heavy for my hair type and could cause breakage.\n\nCan you tell me more about:\n1. How the diffuser is designed for different hair thickness levels?\n2. What's the gentlest setting on this model?\n3. Are there any attachments or accessories for fine/delicate hair?\n4. How does this compare to the BLD-Quiet Care model for gentle drying?\n\nI really want to find the right product for my hair.\n\nThanks,\nJessica Rodriguez\njessica.rodriguez@email.com",
