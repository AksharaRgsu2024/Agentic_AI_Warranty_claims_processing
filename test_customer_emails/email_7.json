  "body": "Hello,\n\nI purchased the BreezeLite BLD-X1 Infrared dryer on April 10, 2026, and I'm very happy with it overall.\n\nHowever, I noticed yesterday that the infrared lamp inside the dryer is no longer illuminating, even though the motor and airflow function normally. This appears to be an internal component failure.\n\nI haven't dropped the unit or exposed it to water. I've used it exactly as instructed in the manual. This seems like a manufacturing defect.\n\nI have the purchase receipt and would appreciate assistance with a warranty claim for repair or replacement.\n\nThank you,\nAngela Martinez\nangela.martinez@email.com\n+1-555-345-6789",
