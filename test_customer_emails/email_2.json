  "body": "Hello,\n\nI need to file a warranty claim for my BreezeLite BLD-2000 Pro-Salon hairdryer that I purchased on April 15, 2026.\n\nUnfortunately, the hairdryer was accidentally knocked into a sink full of water during a busy Saturday at my salon. I immediately unplugged it and let it dry for 24 hours before attempting to use it again.\n\nWhen I turned it on, there was no power and the motor made a clicking sound. The water likely damaged the internal electrical components.\n\nI have the purchase receipt and photos of the water-damaged hairdryer. I'm hoping this can be covered under warranty.\n\nThank you,\nJames Mitchell\njames.mitchell@salon.com\n+1-555-987-6543",
