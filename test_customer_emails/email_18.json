  "body": "Hi,\n\nI've had my BreezeLite BLD-150 for about 5 months now and it's been fantastic. However, I'm interested in upgrading to one of your professional models like the BLD-2000 Pro-Salon.\n\nDo you offer any trade-in programs or discounts for existing customers who want to upgrade? I'd be willing to send my current dryer back if there's a trade-in value.\n\nWhat's the best way to handle this?\n\nThanks,\nThomas Wilson\nthomas.wilson@email.com",
