What heat setting would you recommend for color-treated hair?\n\nDoes your dryer have a specific \"color-safe\" mode or setting, or should I just use the lowest heat setting?\n\nAlso, how often should I clean the air filter? I've noticed it collects dust after about 2 weeks of daily use.\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nBest,\nMaya Patel\nmaya.patel@email.com",
