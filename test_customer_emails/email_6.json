The casing is cracked and the ionic function is no longer working. The motor still runs, but the airflow seems restricted.\n\nI understand this was an accident on my part, but wanted to check if there's any coverage or what repair options might be available.\n\nI have the receipt and photos of the damage.\n\nThanks,\nDavid Chen\ndavid.chen@email.com",
