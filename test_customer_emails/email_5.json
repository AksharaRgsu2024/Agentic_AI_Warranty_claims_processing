  "body": "Hi,\n\nI purchased a BreezeLite BLD-Travel Harmony folding hairdryer back in December 2025. It has been wonderful for my travel needs.\n\nUnfortunately, the folding handle mechanism broke last week when I was closing it up after a trip. The click mechanism that locks the handle in place is no longer working properly.\n\nWhile I realize this might be outside the warranty period (it's been about 6 months), I wanted to reach out and see if there's any coverage or if you have affordable repair options available.\n\nI'm attaching photos of the broken handle mechanism.\n\nThanks,\nPatricia Wong\npatricia.wong@email.com",
