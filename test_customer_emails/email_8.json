The dryer seems to overheat even when set to lower temperatures, which is concerning for client safety and hair quality.\n\nI've used the dryer according to professional standards and it's been maintained properly. This appears to be a sensor or display malfunction.\n\nI need this resolved quickly as I rely on this equipment for my business. Please advise on warranty coverage for the digital display repair or unit replacement.\n\nThanks,\nKevin Lee\nkevin.lee.salon@business.com",
