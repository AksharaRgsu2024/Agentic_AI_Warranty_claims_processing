  "body": "Hi,\n\nI purchased the BreezeLite BLD-Quiet Care dryer on May 2, 2026, specifically for its noise-reduction features.\n\nAfter about a month of use, I noticed that the dryer has become noticeably louder. When I opened it for inspection, I could see that the sound-dampening foam inside the chamber has started to degrade and break down.\n\nI have followed the care instructions and have never exposed the dryer to liquid or cleaning agents. I only use regular air drying and normal heat settings.\n\nI believe this is a manufacturing defect in the acoustic chamber materials. The dryer is still within the warranty period.\n\nPlease advise if this is covered under warranty.\n\nThanks,\nNancy Garcia\nnancy.garcia@email.com",
