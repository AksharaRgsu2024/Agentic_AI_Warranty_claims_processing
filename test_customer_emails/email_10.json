  "body": "Dear BreezeLite Support,\n\nI'm writing about a serious safety concern with my BLD-150 Everyday Dryer purchased on March 8, 2026.\n\nThe power cord insulation has begun fraying near the connection to the unit. I can see exposed wiring in one area, which is obviously a serious electrical hazard.\n\nI have not wrapped the cord around the dryer, dropped the unit, or damaged it in any way. This appears to be a manufacturing defect with the power cord assembly.\n\nThis is still well within the 3-month warranty period. Given the safety risk, I need immediate assistance.\n\nPlease advise on next steps for replacement.\n\nThank you,\nRobert Johnson\nrobert.johnson@email.com\n+1-555-456-7890",
