  "body": "Hello,\n\nI bought my BreezeLite BLD-Curl Master dryer on April 5, 2026, and I love the results it gives for my curly hair.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the mounting ring prongs on the diffuser attachment broke off while I was attaching it to the dryer head. The diffuser can no longer mount securely.\n\nI was careful when attaching it, but the prongs seem quite delicate. I wondered if this could be a manufacturing defect or if it's covered under warranty for replacement.\n\nI have the receipt and photos of the broken diffuser.\n\nThanks,\nLisa Brown\nlisa.brown@email.com",
