  "body": "Dear Support Team,\n\nI purchased a BreezeLite BLD-150 Everyday Dryer on March 20, 2026, and it stopped working after just 2 months.\n\nI always wrap the power cord tightly around the dryer body for storage as I don't have much space in my bathroom cabinet. Recently, when I plugged it in, I noticed sparks coming from the power plug area and the dryer no longer turns on.\n\nI believe the issue is caused by internal wire damage from the cord being wrapped around the unit. I have the receipt and would like to file a warranty claim for a replacement.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah Thompson\nsarah.thompson@email.com",
