  "body": "Dear Patricia Wong,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to personally reach out to you regarding your warranty claim, CLAIM-20260121-180937, that you submitted to us on January 21st, 2026. I appreciate the time you took to share your concerns with us, and I understand how frustrating it must be to experience issues with your BreezeLite BLD-Travel Harmony hairdryer.\n\nI want to assure you that we take all claims seriously and strive to provide the best possible service to our customers. However, after reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we cannot approve it. The warranty period for your hairdryer has lapsed, as it was purchased in December 2025 and the limited warranty period of 3 months has expired.\n\nAdditionally, in order to process your claim, we require specific documentation, including proof of purchase, the serial number of your hairdryer, and usable photographic evidence of the issue. Unfortunately, we did not receive this information with your claim, which prevents us from verifying the defect and processing your request.\n\nRegarding the broken folding handle mechanism on your hairdryer, we consider this to be a normal wear and tear issue, which is excluded from our warranty coverage once the warranty period has expired. Our warranty policy clearly outlines this exclusion, and I want to ensure you have the most accurate and up-to-date information about our products.\n\nAlthough we cannot approve your claim, I'd like to offer you some alternative solutions to help you resolve the issue. We offer repair services for a fee, which might be an option for you if you'd like to continue using your hairdryer. Alternatively, we can provide a discount on a new purchase of a BreezeLite hairdryer, which would ensure you receive a product with the latest features and warranty coverage.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about our policy or would like to discuss further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. I'm here to help and want to ensure you have the best possible experience with our brand.\n\nThank you for choosing BreezeLite, and I hope we can continue to serve you in the future.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nCustomer Service Representative\nBreezeLite Hairdryer Company",
