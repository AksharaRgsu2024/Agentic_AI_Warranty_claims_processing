We appreciate the time you've taken to share the issue of sparks and popping sounds, accompanied by burn marks and discoloration. We're truly sorry for the distress and potential safety risk this has caused.\n\nI'm pleased to inform you that your warranty claim (CLAIM-20260121-164022) has been APPROVED. Our records show that you purchased the hairdryer on March 15, 2026, which falls within our standard 3-month warranty period. Our policy clearly states that defects in workmanship and materials, such as the issue you've described, are covered.\n\nTo move forward with the replacement/refund process, we'll need to arrange for a qualified technician to inspect the hairdryer and power cord. In the meantime, we advise you to discontinue using the hairdryer to ensure your safety. We'll be in touch with further instructions on how to proceed.\n\nOnce the inspection is complete, we'll prepare a replacement unit or refund per our warranty terms. You can expect to receive your replacement within 3-5 business days after the inspection has been completed.\n\nTo facilitate the inspection, please allow us to send safety instructions and contact details for return shipping. Our dedicated team will guide you through the process and ensure a smooth resolution.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at [cs@hairdryerco.com](mailto:cs@hairdryerco.com) or 1-800-HAIR-DRY (1-800-424-7379).
