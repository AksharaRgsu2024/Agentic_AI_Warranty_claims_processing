  "body": "Dear David,\n\nThank you for reaching out to us regarding your concern with your BreezeLite Global hairdryer. We appreciate the time you took to contact us and apologize for any inconvenience you've experienced.\n\nWe understand that your hairdryer has been damaged, and we want to acknowledge your frustration. However, after thoroughly reviewing your claim (CLAIM-20260121-181019), we regret to inform you that we are unable to approve it for warranty coverage.\n\nThe damage to your hairdryer appears to be caused by an accidental drop, which is specifically excluded under the BreezeLite Global warranty terms. Our warranty policy clearly states that it does not cover damage resulting from misuse, accidents, or physical stress.\n\nAdditionally, we were unable to verify the purchase date of your hairdryer as no receipt was provided, and photographic evidence was not submitted to support your claim. As per our warranty policy, we require this information to substantiate your claim and determine eligibility for coverage.\n\nWe want to emphasize that our warranty only covers defects in workmanship and materials, not physical damage caused by accidents. We understand this may be disappointing, but we're committed to providing the best possible support to our customers.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring repair options, we can offer you a competitive quote for our repair service. Alternatively, you may be eligible for a discount on a new BreezeLite Global hairdryer purchase. Please let us know if you'd like to discuss these options further, and we'll be happy to assist you.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about our warranty policy or claim process, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help and appreciate your understanding.\n\nThank you for choosing BreezeLite Global, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you better in the future.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nCustomer Service Representative\nBreezeLite Global",
