We appreciate the time you took to share your concern with us, and we're sorry to hear that your product has been damaged.\n\nWe understand that dealing with a malfunctioning product can be frustrating, and we acknowledge your right to expect a certain level of performance from our products. After reviewing your claim, we would like to explain why we cannot approve your warranty request.\n\nAccording to our warranty policy terms, damage resulting from immersion in water is explicitly excluded from coverage. Unfortunately, the damage to your BLD-2000 appears to have been caused by water exposure, which falls under this exclusion. Although your claim was submitted within the three-month warranty window, the exclusion takes precedence over the time-frame eligibility.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to inform you that we were unable to verify your purchase due to the lack of required documentation (purchase receipt) and photographic evidence. Our warranty policy requires this information to ensure the authenticity of the product and the purchase date. Without this verification, we cannot proceed with the claim.\n\nWe understand that this news may be disappointing, but we want to assure you that we're committed to providing alternatives to help you get the most out of your hairdryer. If you're interested, we can offer a repair service at a competitive price, or we can provide a discount on a new purchase of the BLD-2000 or any other model that suits your needs.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to explore these options, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help and want to ensure that you're satisfied with our response.\n\nThank you for choosing BreezeLite, and we appreciate your understanding in this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nCustomer Service Representative\nBreezeLite Hairdryer Company",
