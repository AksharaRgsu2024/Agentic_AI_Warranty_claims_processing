  "body": "Dear Kevin Lee,\n\nThank you for reaching out to us regarding your claim, CLAIM-20260121-181142. I appreciate the time you've taken to share your concerns with us, and I'm happy to address them.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's frustrating to experience issues with your BreezeLite hairdryer, and I understand how important it is for you to have a reliable product, especially in a busy commercial salon environment.\n\nAfter reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we cannot approve your warranty claim at this time. Our warranty policy clearly states that commercial use of our products is an exclusion from coverage (Section 3, Article C of our Warranty Terms and Conditions). Unfortunately, your salon falls into this category, and we cannot provide warranty support for products used in such environments.\n\nAdditionally, in order to process a warranty claim, we require proof of purchase and photographic evidence of the defect. In this case, we did not receive either of these documents from you, which makes it difficult for us to verify the issue and determine the cause of the malfunction. I understand that this may not have been your intention, but I want to ensure that we handle all claims fairly and in accordance with our policies.\n\nI want to assure you that we value your business and appreciate your loyalty to the BreezeLite brand. Although we cannot provide warranty support, I'd like to inform you that our repair service may be an option for you. Our team can assess your hairdryer and provide a quote for any necessary repairs. Alternatively, if you're interested in purchasing a new product, we'd be happy to offer you a discount on your next purchase.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this decision, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. I'm more than happy to assist you and provide any additional information you may need.\n\nThank you for understanding our position on this matter, and I wish you continued success with your salon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nCustomer Service Representative\nBreezeLite Hairdryer Co.",
