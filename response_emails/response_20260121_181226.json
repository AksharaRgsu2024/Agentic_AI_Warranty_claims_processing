  "body": "Dear Lisa Brown,\n\nThank you for reaching out to us regarding your claim (CLAIM-20260121-181219). We appreciate the time you took to share your concerns with us, and we're sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with your hairdryer.\n\nWe understand that a broken diffuser prong can be frustrating, and we're here to help. However, after reviewing your claim, we regret to inform you that we cannot approve it under our warranty policy. Our policy explicitly states that physical damage to the diffuser attachment is not covered, and this appears to be the case with your issue.\n\nWhile your claim was filed within the 3-month warranty window, the exclusion for physical damage to the diffuser attachment takes precedence. Unfortunately, without the required evidence (a receipt for the original purchase and clear photos of the broken part), we cannot proceed with the claim.\n\nWe want to assure you that we're committed to providing you with the best possible service. If you're interested, we can provide you with repair service quotes or offer a discount on a new purchase of a replacement diffuser or even a full hairdryer. Please let us know if either of these options appeal to you, and we'll be happy to discuss the details further.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to reply to this email or contact us directly. We're here to help and appreciate your understanding in this matter.\n\nThank you for choosing our hairdryer, and we hope you'll continue to enjoy using it.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nCustomer Service Representative\n[Hairdryer Company]",
