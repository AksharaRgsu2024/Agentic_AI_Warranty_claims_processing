  "body": "Dear Sarah,\n\nThank you for reaching out to us regarding your BLD-150 hairdryer. I want to express my apologies for the issue you've encountered, and I appreciate you taking the time to share the details of your concern with us.\n\nI understand that your BLD-150 stopped functioning, and you're looking for assistance under our warranty program. I've thoroughly reviewed your claim (CLAIM-20260121-180822) and would like to provide you with an update.\n\nUnfortunately, after careful consideration, I regret to inform you that your claim does not meet the criteria for warranty coverage. The root cause of the issue, as reported, appears to be user-induced damage, specifically the tightening of the cord, which is an explicit exclusion in the BreezeLite warranty terms.\n\nIn addition, we require specific documentation to process any warranty claim, including a receipt photo, product serial number, and visual evidence of the defect. Unfortunately, these essential documents were not provided in your submission.\n\nAlthough the claim was filed within the warranty period, which is 2.5 months after purchase, the combination of misuse and insufficient evidence makes the claim ineligible for coverage. Our warranty policy clearly outlines the circumstances under which claims will be accepted, and I'm afraid this case does not meet those criteria.\n\nHowever, I'd like to offer you an alternative solution. Our repair service team can assist you in fixing your hairdryer for a fee. Alternatively, if you're interested in replacing your BLD-150, we can provide you with a discount on a new purchase.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding this decision, or if you'd like to discuss the repair or replacement options further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. I'm here to assist you and ensure a smooth resolution.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I hope you'll consider our alternatives for resolving this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nCustomer Service Representative\nBreezeLite Hairdryers",
